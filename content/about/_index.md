I am Adri√°n Gallego Castellanos, a developer passionated about learning new technologies. I really enjoy system programing, paralellism and distributed system. I started as a self taught prorammer when I was sixteen years old, and my first programming languages to learn were Python and Bash. Later, I did a degree on computer science at Universite Carlos III of Madrid, where I learned the structure of the computers and how to optimize the programs I wrote. It is here where my passion for distributed system and parallelism began.

Currently, I am proud to be working at Zhilabs, a Samsung Company which provides solutions to help service providers to monitor and analyze their networks, and to detect and prevent network problems. My position here is that of kubernetes developer and administrator, what let me design distributed applications which run on top of kubernetes. Moreover, our solutions have to be fast and reliable, so I use to work with paralellism.

I really enjoy learning new technologies, so I do not fear to get involved in open source projects and spend my free time coding the solution for a cool problem. The main reason why I decided to open this blog is to share my learning experience with others, with two goals, the first one, to understand better my solution while explaining it, the second one, to allow others to learn from what I have learned.

I hope you enjoy reading this blog as much as I am doing writing it.
