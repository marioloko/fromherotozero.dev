This is _Adri√°n Gallego Castellanos'_ personal blog. 

The posts in this blog reflect my interest in learning new technologies and to improve my knowledge.
My main interests are Rust, parallelism and distributed systems, so the content will mostly focus on these topics.

The name _From Hero To Zero_ is because to become a real expert, or a hero,
first you have to practice, to learn from the experience and to get real life results.
But later, when you already have the experience to solve the problem, comes the time to really understand
the problem and the solution, and is in this moment when you go deeper and deeper to understand the root
of your solution, the zero. Is in this moment when you really learn and go a step further to become an expert.

My goal is to become a real expert, so I will explain to you the problems and solution I find in my path of
learning new technologies.
